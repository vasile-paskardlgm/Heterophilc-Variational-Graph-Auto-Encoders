# Heterophilc-Variational-Graph-Auto-Encoders
***A sub-problem of my big idea: "Bridging the gap between Graph Signal Processing and Graph Learning"***  
## Problem Definition 
**Supposed there is a *Heterophilc graph:G(V,E,X)*, which means the edge(i,j) exists when node i and j are different in their labels. Note that there is another similar but not same definition in *Heterophilc graph:G(V,E,X)*:edge(i,j) exists when node i and j are different in their features.
