# Heterophilc-Variational-Graph-Auto-Encoders
***One of the sub-problems of my big idea: "Bridging the gap between Graph Signal Processing and Graph Learning"***  
## Problem Definition 
Supposed there is a **Heterophilc graph:G(V,E,X)**, which means the edge(i,j) exists when node i and j are different in their labels. Note that there is another similar but not same definition in **Heterophilc graph:G(V,E,X)**:edge(i,j) exists when node i and j are different in their features.  
  
We think about link-prediction in such a heterophilc graph. Specially, we treat it as a graph signal processing problem and solve it with a perspective of spectral graph network.
